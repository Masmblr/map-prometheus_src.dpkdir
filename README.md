Prometheus is a demonstration map for my texture pack. 
This map brings together all the unfinished components that have accumulated over the years, 
including the map 'Stahl'. This will be my final map for Unvanquished.

First attempt. Basic design: metallic-technical, dirty, focus on light and shadow, kept rather dark but not too dark. I believe I will skip floodlights as they destroy strong shading.
