# Prometheus - A Demonstrator Map for my Texture-Set
![header](readme_files/header.jpg) 

## Overview  
Prometheus is a custom map for the open-source FPS/RTS hybrid game *Unvanquished*.  
It was designed as a demonstrator for my texture set [mas01](https://github.com/Masmblr/mas01-Texture-Set). 
The dev blog for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Masmblr/map-prometheus_src.dpkdir/blob/main/readme_files/old_dev_blog.md). 

## Story
> **CLASSIFIED TRANSMISSION**  
> **To: Squad Leader – Tactical Response Unit**  
> **From: Central Command**  
> **Encryption Level: OMEGA – EYES ONLY**  
> 
> **Squad Leader,**  
>  
> You're being deployed to **Prometheus Base**.  
> We don’t have much intel, and what little we do have is fragmented.  
>  
> ### **Mission Briefing**  
>  
> Prometheus is an inhospitable world—**cold, barren, and endlessly battered by powerful winds**.  
> The planet’s surface consists primarily of yellow sandstone, with a few scattered outposts spread across the terrain.  
> The main facility, now abandoned, was one of them.  
>  
> There was an **incident** involving a native lifeform.  
> Reports—what little we recovered—mention an **organic, worm-like structure** that **breached the rear section of the vehicle bay**.  
> The base administration initiated an investigation.  
> 
> According to recovered data fragments, **one or more entities emerged from the breach**.  
> Shortly after, systems started failing across the facility.  
> Command was left with no choice but to order an **immediate evacuation**.  
>  
> **No reinforcements were sent. No distress signals were answered.**  
>  
> This is the last recorded transmission from the base:  
>  
> ---

> [LOG ENTRY 927-A]  
> DATE: Unknown  
> LOCATION: Prometheus, Main Base  
> STATUS: ABANDONED  
> 
>     Initial breach detected in vehicle storage.  
>     Unidentified organic entity confirmed.  
>     Power failure: 87% of facility offline.  
>     Security override: FAILED.  
>     Evacuation order: ISSUED.  
> 
> Mission Update: Tactical response team deployed.  
> Objective: Secure the base and neutralize threats.  
> ```
> ---
>  
> That was the **last** communication before the base went dark.  
>  
> Your mission is **clear**:  
>  
> **Secure the base.**  
> **Assess the threat.**  
> **Eliminate if necessary.**  
>  
> There are no known survivors. **Expect resistance.**  
> And Squad Leader—whatever came through that breach, **it’s still there.**  
>  
> **No reinforcements will be sent.**  
> You’re on your own.  
>  
> **Command out.**  

## Features  
- **Layout:** Designed to provide fair opportunities for both teams. Each team has an interactive element they can control. First, they must build either a drill (for Humans) or a booster (for Aliens) at the designated locations. Once activated, a red switch must be pressed to trigger the mechanism.

- Humans can control a bridge, which can block or open a strategic corridor:

- Aliens can activate or deactivate a heat-conducting pipeline. When active, it deals damage, creating a hazard for all ground units:
